Step,Parameter name,Control type,Weight in score,High quality (1 pt),Acceptable quality (0.5 pt),Poor quality (0 pt),QC follow-up,Over/underestimation or false pos/neg if parameter out of range,Explanation
Sampling,Number of hours represented by composite,quantitative performance,5,≥ 20 hrs or missing data,≥10 hrs,< 10 or grab sample,none,false neg,"Less than 24 hours represented indicates an issue with the autosampler, suggesting an incomplete sample and possible over/underestimation of concentration or false negative"
Sampling,Additional notes about the sample,qualitative performance,NA,NA,NA,NA,read notes in this field,NA,Samplers and laboratory personnel at wastewater agencies sometimes write comments about samples when something unusual occurs or is observed during sampling.
Sampling,sample hold time,quantitative performance,10,< 3 days,< 5 days,> 5 days,none,false neg/underestimation,Hold time could decrease the reported quantity of SARS-CoV-2 due to RNA degradation
Extraction,extraction negative control,negative control,10,True (no amplification),control is > 1 Cq above sample,control Cq is within 1 of sample,remove data; extract additional biological replicate,false pos/overestimation,"Extraction controls test for sample cross-contamination that could lead to false positives. Based on several months of observation in our lab, there may be low-level cross-contamination of PMMoV (from samples into extraction blank), but there should never be cross-contamination of N1. If the extraction negative control amplifies, the quality score for a given sample will be substantially lowered if the concentration in that sample is within 1 Ct of the control."
Extraction,extraction processing error,qualitative performance,10,none,none,"error reported (clogged column, spilled sample)",read notes in this field,false neg/underestimation,"Extraction errors include sample spilled and column clogged. The RNA extraction is performed using a silica column which sometimes clogs due to wastewater debris. If the column clogs, only a fraction of the sample will be processed, leading to underestimation / lower sensitivity / higher potential for false negative results. Samples from some locations are more prone to clogging than others."
Extraction,extraction recovery efficiency,quantitative performance,10,> 10%,> 5%,< 5% or missing data,remove data; extract additional biological replicate,false neg/underestimation,"Indication of the success of RNA extraction. If below the threshold, higher potential for false negatives in SARS-CoV-2 detection"
Extraction,human fecal indicator virus concentration,quantitative performance / positive control,10,>1e3,>1e2,< 1e2 or missing data,remove data,false neg/underestimation,"Indication of the success of RNA extraction. If below the threshold, higher potential for false negatives in SARS-CoV-2 detection"
qPCR,no-template control,negative control,10,True (no amplification),control is > 1 Cq above sample,control Cq is within 1 of sample,"rerun plate, replace data",false pos/overestimation,"No-template controls (NTCs) are run in triplicate on each qPCR plate. Amplification in the NTC indicates potential cross-contamination on a plate. If the no-template control amplifies, the quality score for a given sample will be substantially lowered if the concentration in that sample is within 1 Ct of the control."
qPCR,efficiency,quantitative performance,10,90-110%,80-120%,< 80% or > 120%,"rerun plate, replace data","underestimation (if below 100%), overestimation (if above 100%)","Efficiency reflects how well the qPCR worked. Our qPCR assays have been optimized to 100% efficiency, but there may be some plate-to-plate variation due to reagents and environmental factors. Lower efficiency indicates that the template did not amplify as well as expected and may be underreported"
qPCR,number of points in standard curve,positive control,10,≥ 5,≥3,<3,"if standards failed to amplify, reanalyze all samples on the plate",false neg/underestimation,"Number of points on the standard curve. Our assay should always detect all or nearly all standards within the range of the 7-point standard curve. If standards fail to amplify, it could indicate an issue with the mastermix that may have affected samples on the same plate."
qPCR,geometric standard deviation of the quantities determined by triplicate qPCR reactions for a sample,quantitative performance,10,< 2 or PCR nondetect,< 4,≥ 4,none,either,"Geometric standard deviation of quantity among 3 technical replicates. The higher this is, the more likely there was a technical error in qPCR."
qPCR,presence of qPCR inhibition,qualitative performance,5,False (no inhibition or status unknown),True,Missing data,none,underestimation,"Wastewater contains substances that interfere with PCR, leading to depressed values. We assay for SARS-CoV-2 using both undiluted and 5-fold diluted RNA. If there was inhibition, dilution can lead to a cleaner sample input and higher concentrations (after accounting for dilution), so this is acceptable.  We compare the results from diluted and undiluted samples to determine if there was inhibition.  If inhibition was present, the concentration may be underreported. If only one point amplified (1x or 5x), then the status of inhibition is unknown."
